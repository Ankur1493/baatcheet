# Baatcheet

This is a chat application, ps - don't judge the code it was written in a really fast way just to learn redis and socketio from docs, these are not the best practices for sure, but they give results.

## Things which can be improved:-

1. Add the user photo with messages
2. create a proper user profile page, with clerk
3. performance
4. database models can be created in a more good way

If you can improve these changes, go ahead and create a pull request
